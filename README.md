# SQL for Data Analysis (Oracle SQL Edition)
## About
This project is a fork of the original "SQL for Data Analysis" book by Tanimura Cathy, where all the examples were initially written in PostgreSQL. The goal of this fork is to provide Oracle SQL users with equivalent examples and exercises to enhance their data analysis skills using Oracle Database.
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Oracle Database installed and running on your system (this repo was created using Oracle version 21c). You will need appropriate privileges to create and manipulate databases and tables.
## Usage
Navigate through the directories to find SQL scripts for different chapters and exercises. Each script file contains comments explaining the purpose of the SQL statements.
## Completed chapters
All chapters are completely rewriten for Oracle SQL
